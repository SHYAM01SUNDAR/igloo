# House Price Prediction Model

## Overview
This Jupyter Notebook contains code for building a machine learning model to predict house prices based on various features such as location, property characteristics, and market trends. The model aims to provide accurate predictions to assist stakeholders in the real estate market, including homebuyers, sellers, investors, and financial institutions.

## Files
- `House_Price_Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
- `USA_Housing.csv`: Sample dataset containing features and target variable (house prices).

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation**: Ensure the `USA_Housing.csv` dataset is available in the same directory as the notebook.
2. **Environment Setup**: Install the required Python libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. **Run Notebook**: Open and execute the `House_Price_Prediction.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook.
4. **Follow Instructions**: Follow the instructions within the notebook to preprocess data, train the model, evaluate performance, and make predictions.
5. **Interpret Results**: Analyze model performance metrics and predicted house prices to gain insights into the real estate market.
